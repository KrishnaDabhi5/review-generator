    "and made with freshly squeezed orange juice.",
    "triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur made from the dried peels of bitter sweet oranges.",

    "thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first then the cocktail.",
    "the mocktail was served along with chicken taco.",
    "the mocktail was made with fresh kiwi mint.",

    "usually in bars they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.",
    "after that i tried their chicken taco.",
    "those tacos were made for indians so you can't get the blunt taste but the real fusion works here.",
    "those tacos were stuffed with indian spiced grilled chicken and topped with mint raita and served in malabar ghee fried parotas.",
    "taste wise they were so good but the only thing which bothered me the malabar parota.",
    "as the parotas have layers so it was difficult to hold the entire thing.",
    "so i suggested to use plain wheat fourmaida tortillas i believe the taste will also go better with the indian spiced grilled chicken.",
    "and yes the tacos were too filling i could have only 2 of them.",
    "now it's time for the cocktail which was literally inviting me to taste it.",
    "and believe me it was kicking offso strong but nice orange flavored very refreshing.",

    "i liked to try these sambousek with sweet tamarind chutney it went so well together.",
    "now you might be wondering what baharat spice is as per the chef the word baharat actually means spices in arabic and not a single spice but a blend of several spices.",
    "so the chicken keema was cooked with these spices.",
    "though the sombousek looks pretty similar with samosa but the taste was very different.",
    "and that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.",
    "i felt the food quality quantity is quite enough satisfactory as per price.",
    "definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.",
    "monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have got being screened then things get better.",

    "you can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail.",
    "the bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving.",
    "my next cocktail was thyme of your life well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice.",
    "now this drink actually gives you a kick in first sip itself.",
    "the peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste.",
    "coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time i finally ordered the indianised version of pasta- fusili in kasuri methi and coriander sauce.",
    "the name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce.",

    "for veg their was mutter paneer and paneer butter masala.",
    "i liked their mutter paneer as it was really balanced in terms of flavor.",
    "their biryani was a slight disappointment for me.",

    "apart from this i also had my hands on their veg thai curry.",
    "to be honest the preparation of thai green curry was too good but the only thing which upset me was that it was sweeter than the normal version.",

    "recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at marsala food company we had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is well to start with as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement they have the arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down the place is dimly lit and very calm you can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the dlf gate no 3 opposite to which is this place marsala food company so after we settled down they brought in the soups we had the arabian chicken soup and the lemon coriander soup we just loved the arabian chicken soup it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg the starters included chicken pahadi paneer papdi kung pao mushroom dragon chicken haryali fish tikka golden fried prawns golden fried babycorn chilli paneer lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka starters were really good in taste specially the non veg and seafood starters chicken pahadi a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint coriander ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt had a very refreshing and delectable taste the chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked the dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste the golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste these are really crispy and amazingly tasty you definitely are going to love the starters here next they brought their famous mandis on our table which included mutton juicy marg mandi grilled chicken mandi and fish fried mandi although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the grilled chicken mandi the rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy and the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender the quantity was also ample...it can serve 4 in between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight strawberry was our favourite made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also you will order for another one and at the end of it all we were served the desserts...the desserts which you commonly see in the hyderabadi functions they had the qubani ka meetha double ka meetha kaddu ki kheer and gulab jamun we strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts they were just okay-ish dessert is the way to man's heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly but overall it was a good experience here at marsala the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken mandi",
    "it was worth it as a side.",
    "this is a must try desserts- gulab jamun-soft delicious ball of love dipped in sugar syrup.",
    "loved by all hyderabadis one cannot miss.",
    "double ka meetha-signature dessert of hyderabadi dawat which is loved by everyone.",

    "one is for people who love to sit down and eat which was used in ancient times another is a normal seating arrangment on a table.",
    "staff is very friendly ambience 55 service 55 taste 55 a worth trying place for every person with a group of friends.",
    "dragon chicken and hariyali fish is a must try.",
    "im in love with the chicken mandi here.",
    "lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell.",
    "tandoori is my favourite....it is delicious.....my friend suggested me this restaurant",
    "next we had starters.chicken pahadi- the pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.the pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.the flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.next we had paneer papdi kebab.this is batter fried paneer slices.the batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.kung pao mushroom was okayish.it tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in kung pao dishes.dragon chicken and hariyali fish tikka both were amazing.i do recommend these.golden fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.it was good but did not feel like having prawns.golden fried baby corn was also good.chilli paneer was disappointing.the paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.lahori chicken kabab was also pretty good.mushroom moti tikki is something i would avoid.i did not like it but i feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.it is khova filled mushrooms.i could not eat it and so i am not recommending this but you could give it a try.what if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.",
    "next we had mandis.the juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the chicken mandi.the rice of the mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.the fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.the pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.the fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.the fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.the best mandi you ask then definitely go for the chicken mandi.",
    "we also had some milkshakes- kitkatbutterscotch and strawberry.i loved the kitkat milkshake the most.it had chunks of kitkat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.the milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.",
    "overall i would say most of the non veg starters were good and the mandis too are good.the desserts need improvement.the place is definitely worth a visit.",
    "sharing my experience at marsala food company as soon as you enter just have a look at the the roof decor it's just amazing and when you get in further to the seating area you'll find the regular dinning tables and chairs and then you'll also find couches and tables well as this place serves arabian food specifically for mandi ppl some ppl prefer seating on the couches and making themselves comfortable while enjoying their meal the decor is decent and the service was also good let me start with the food review now so i had arabian chicken soup which was so rich and creamy next i got my hands on their starters like chicken pahadi kkebab chicken banjara kebab kung pao mushroom paneer papdi kebab veg seekh kebab dragon chicken lahori chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what i liked the most among the starters were kung pao mushroom dragon chicken and banjara kebab and i felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious getting into the main course now i tried mutton juicy mandi chicken tangdi mandi and grilled fish mandi i personally liked chicken tangdi mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as i love spicy food treating myself with the milkshakes and desserts now in milkshakes i tried chocolate butterscotch and kitkat i liked the kitkat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of ice-cream and then kitkat as a cherry on the top and in desserts i had gajar ka halwa double ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer i liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar ka halwa and double ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all i would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper arabian meal",

    "prawns were a little salty and the fish wasn't cooked really well...soo there's a room for improvement when it comes to the sea food but they have covered it all up with their delicious biryanis a complete delight to your eyes and to your taste buds as well we had the ulavacharu chicken biryani chicken avakai biryani and chicken afghani biryani totally totally worth the money and just the best ulavacharu biryani made of the spices from horse gram has that khatta meetha taste in it making it soo soo damn awesome it is said that ulavacharu gives heat to your body soo don't forget to have some curd yoghurt or the raita to make it even and then there was this chicken avakai biryani yet another mindblowing taste avakai means mango..and this biryani is made from the spices of mango...it had the taste of the mango pickle never had we imagined that we'd ever be eating chicken biryani with the taste of mango pickle then came the afghani biryani...it's just the opposite of ulavacharu and avakai when it comes to the spicy level really flavourful and palatable biryani served with an omelette on top believe us if you're a biryani lover then this place should be definitely be in your list i'm gonna go back again for the biryani the other main course included naan basket with chicken tikka masala and chicken chettinadu as you must be knowing chicken chettinadu a popular dish from tamil nadu is a very spicy dish and yet very tasty and here at biryanis and more they have kept up with that level of spicy-ness and also the taste soo the main course here is the real stunner next we had the desserts...ever wished to be ganesh gaitonde you definitely do not want that life but yes you can enjoy the same dessert which he just loves the kharvas also called as junnu is an indian milk pudding and it is made from the colostrum of the cow we don't know how the actual taste of the junnu is as we never had it before but yes here at biryanis and more the taste was superb you ought to have this dessert to get that gaitonde feels next in line were the gulab jamun and qubani ka meetha the presentation of the desserts isn't really appealing soo the hotel management should definitely look after that and make some changes but the taste was good soo if you love to enjoy a variety in biryani then biryanis and more should be your next stop you're going to love it",

    "hyderabadi daawat as the name suggests has some authentic hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in hyderabad ever been to a hyderabadi daawat before no not the hotel we're talking about a function well if you've been to one then you definitely know how much a hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the menu and here at hyderabadi daawat the restaurant you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy the hotel is very easy to locate its on the main road...while coming from orr or gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you're coming from miyapur side then it will be on your left the restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors very calm and cozy place they also have banquet hall and a conference hall and they also undertake catering orders for parties and functions and after the dastar was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the yakhni shorba shorba is nothing but the soup yakhni shorba is a dish from kashmir...people in the north tend to have it more and it is a very good source of protein usually it is mild in spice level but at hyderabadi daawat owing to the spice cravings of hyderabadis it was made a little spicy but the taste was fantastic it was the best way to start off your meal next came the starters in which we were served the wok tossed chicken phuket fish sikandari raan and murgh sholay kebab let's start with what we loved the most the sikandari raan it's one whole leg from the goat or sheep you know for a fact that mutton and beefs aren't usually as tender as chicken but the chefs at hyderabadi daawat changed this notion entirely the mutton from the raan was soo soft tender and juicy that your teeth has no work to do...cause it just melts and talking about the spices...it was very mild in spice and very well marinated coming to the significance of the name sikandari raan most of you must be knowing that alexander the great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as sikandar e azam after winning one of the battles in 300 b.c at takshila he took the ruler called porus as captive and when porus was asked what he wanted he told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo alexander or sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this raan was signature dish and since then it is named as sikandari raan well we think no other name would have justified the size and taste of this dish better than sikandari raan a must must have for you all highly recommended dish if you're here the next best starter was the phuket fish it's a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions ginger garlic paste and tossed in soya and chilli sauce the taste was of another level next we had the wok tossed chicken wok tossed is an east asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming the taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew soo we recommend the chef to look into that and next came the murgh sholay kebab it was the barbeque styled chicken very nicely marinated and tender to eat and the presentation was amazingly done after we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called chelo kebab it was extremely well presented chelo kebab is an iranian dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs the chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour after this the main course was started in which we were served the chicken lababdar nihari gosht and murgh musallam with butter naan nihari gosht was love it wasn't like the usual nihari that you eat on a regular basis it was different and very thick and spicy and the mutton which they used was really tender do try this dish here chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo murgh musallam was completely different here when compared to the murgh musallam we had at other places here they serve the murgh musallam with rice and the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs you should definitely try this dish we were done with all this but how can you even think that a hyderabadi daawat would end without the hyderabadi biryani we had the mutton biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions the aroma of the ghee added to the taste of the biryani and the daawat came to an end with the desserts you commonly find in a hyderabadi daawat...matka firni and double ka meetha double ka meetha is the very usual dish you see in the functions of hyderabad it is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added and at hyderabadi daawat it was perfectly made and was served hot overall the lunch here was a terrific experience and we all just loved it and also a special mention to the owner of this place who is a very kind hearted and a humble person he speaks to you related anything and everything you have to ask or tell and takes the feedback whether good or bad with a smile way to go sir",

    "patrani fish wrapped inside a banana i'm guessing leaf was topped with a layer of mint chutney although the fish was heavenly i'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney tandoori jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second musttry starter the drinks got mixed reactions well 60 of them being below average and another 40 being extraordinary it was a rollercoaster in this dept.",
